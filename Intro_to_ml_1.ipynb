    "Artificial Intelligence (AI):\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence is a broad field of computer science focused on creating machines or software that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, learning, reasoning, understanding natural language, and perception. AI can be further categorized into Narrow AI (or Weak AI) and General AI (or Strong AI). Narrow AI refers to AI systems that are designed for specific tasks, while General AI would possess human-like intelligence capable of performing a wide range of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Virtual personal assistants like Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa are examples of Narrow AI. They can understand and respond to voice commands, answer questions, and perform tasks like setting alarms or sending messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML):\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on developing algorithms that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, a machine learning model learns patterns and relationships from data, allowing it to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for each specific scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider a spam email filter. Instead of manually specifying rules for what constitutes spam, a machine learning model can be trained on a dataset of emails, learning to identify common characteristics of spam emails (e.g., keywords, sender patterns). Once trained, it can classify new emails as spam or not based on what it has learned from the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning:\n",
    "Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that is particularly focused on artificial neural networks. Deep neural networks consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that can automatically extract hierarchical features from data. Deep learning has shown remarkable success in tasks like image and speech recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) used in image recognition are a type of deep learning model. These networks learn to identify features at different levels of abstraction. For instance, in image recognition, a CNN might first identify edges, then shapes, and finally complex objects within an image. This hierarchical feature extraction enables deep learning models to achieve high accuracy in tasks like image classification."
